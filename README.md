# Rate Monotonic Scheduling Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation and documentation of the Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) algorithm, a priority algorithm used in Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) for scheduling tasks.

## Overview
Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) is a static priority scheduling algorithm where tasks with shorter periods have higher priority. This repository includes the source code, examples, and documentation to help understand and implement RMS.

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the RMS algorithm.
- `examples/`: Includes example inputs and outputs to demonstrate the algorithm.
- `docs/`: Documentation and references related to RMS.
